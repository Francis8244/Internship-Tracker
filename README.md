This project is something that I am working on as I am starting to learn Node.js, React.js, and MySQL. It will keep track of all the internships I applied for by 
storing the name of the company I applied to, the date I applied, and my current status with the company. React.js will work as my front end, and Node.js will work as the
back end server and will use express to connect to my SQL database.
Progress so far:
