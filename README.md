This project keeps tracks of all the internships I applied to; I can store three data components of the internship: the company I applied to, the date I applied, and the status of the application, and this data gets sent from the front-end all the way to the data base. I can also display all the internships in my database in the front-end with the click of a button, and I'm also able to update the status of an application by putting in the company name and the status I want to change it to. Lastly, I can check how many internships I currently applied for with another press of a button. This project was made with JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and MySQL.
